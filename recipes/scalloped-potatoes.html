    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These fancy scalloped potatoes are a dish in which potato slices are layered around a baking dish to create a beautiful crust for a rosemary potato filling.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced fresh rosemary</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>3 ½ pounds red potatoes</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups whole milk </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Coat an 8-inch baking dish cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Mix Parmesan cheese, rosemary, and garlic together in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Slice 3 or 4 potatoes using a mandolin on the thinnest setting. Slice remaining potatoes using a slightly thicker setting on the mandolin.</li>
            <li>Line the bottom of the prepared baking dish with thin potato slices, overlapping them to create a layer that is 2 to 3 slices deep. Stand remaining thin slices along the sides of the baking dish so that half an inch sticks over the rim, overlapping them to create a layer that is 4 slices deep.</li>
            <li>Spread 1/3 of the thicker potato slices in the baking dish. Sprinkle 1/3 of the Parmesan cheese mixture on top. Repeat once more. Arrange remaining potato slices in the baking dish. Reserve 1/3 of the Parmesan cheese mixture.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat; whisk in flour. Pour in milk; cook, occasionally stirring, until sauce thickens, 5 to 6 minutes. Stir in salt.</li>
            <li>Shift potato slices in a few places with a knife to create wells for the sauce to flow through. Pour sauce evenly over potato slices in the baking dish. Sprinkle remaining 1/3 of the Parmesan cheese mixture on top. Brush potato edges sticking out of the baking dish with olive oil.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes are soft and edges are crusted, 1 hour to 1 hour and 15 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
